      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Make a project site that can display stuff I am working on on various pages. Some pages may be small games in js, others might be a gallery of videos or images. Just a beginning exploration into making something useful to put on the web. My personal goal is to emulate janky websites from the old web days where it was just some dude making a blog with awful colors and flashy lights. The value add for this website will be basically nothing other than what is shown on the face. I want visitors to the sit to be left with a small moment of joy or something silly like that. No information will be necessary to interact with the site. </p>
      <p>The first page will be a test page describing practice with CSS and showing a few ways to do so.</p>  
      <p>The second page will be a little birthday page with pictures, a comment board, a video embed, and a full page background.</p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience for this website is going to be pretty much just me and my friends.</p>  <!-- change this -->

      <h2>Branding</h2>
      <h3>Website Logo</h3>
      <!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

      <h3>Drawing Board</h3>
      <p>
        This page is supposed to be a little drawing board js project within the html of a website. Something like MS paint, with a handful of tools and colors, and instructions at the top underneath a button

      <h3>Project 2: Birthday</h3>
      <p>         
        This is a birthday page templater so I can make quick birthday pages and host them under new names whenever I wanna gift one to a family or friend. Pretty self explanatory. Nothing complex.

      <h3>Project 3: Paint</h3>
      <p>         
        This page is an artboard. People can draw with tools and colors, then save their creation locally. It's going to be the hardest subpage for sure.
